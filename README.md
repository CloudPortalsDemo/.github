## CloudPortalsDemo

Educational demos of **static download portals**:
- Clean UI + minimal JS
- Base64-encoded configs fetched at runtime
- Deployable to GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel
- Classroom- and workshop-friendly

**Repos you’ll find here**
- `nova-download-portal` — a polished UI with spinner/loader and automatic redirect
- `manifest-hub` — simple public manifest hosting (Base64-encoded link)
- More small labs and templates coming soon

> Goal: show how to build fast, transparent, front-end–only file delivery portals for teaching and demos.
